# Coin.io 🪙

Welcome to **CryptoCoin.io**, the ultimate multiplayer web game where cryptocurrency dreams come to life! Think *Agar.io* meets the blockchain—start as a tiny coin like BTC or ETH, gobble up gold coins, and grow into a crypto titan. Will you dominate the leaderboard as the fattest Bitcoin, or get swallowed by a sneaky XRP? Dive in and find out!

## What’s This All About? 🚀
In *CryptoCoin.io*, you’re a cryptocurrency on a mission. Pick from the top 200 coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, you name it!), navigate a wild 2D world, and collect shiny gold coins to grow. Watch out—bigger coins can eat you, but if you’re clever, you’ll be the one doing the eating. It’s real-time, it’s chaotic, and it’s powered by WebSockets for that sweet, sweet multiplayer action.

### Features (So Far):
- **Be Your Favorite Coin:** Type a ticker (e.g., “BTC”) and become it—complete with custom colors and symbols.
- **Grow or Get Got:** Collect gold coins to bulk up, but avoid the big players… or become one!
- **Live Multiplayer:** Thanks to WebSockets, you’re battling real people in real time.
- **Simple & Addictive:** Move with your mouse, grow, and dominate. Easy to learn, hard to master.
